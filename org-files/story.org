* Tensorflow Java support
** Goal
Loading a tensorflow model in Java and making predictions with that model
The model is the one that predicts the winning bid for an auction
*** Requirements
** Supported Platforms
- Ubuntu 16.04 or higher; 64-bit, x86
- macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or higher
- Windows 7 or higher; 64-bit, x86

** Process
*** Docker image CPU
To build the binary image

*** Load model
*** Test model
*** TODO Load TF library
*** TODO close TF graph
https://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/?api=org.tensorflow.SavedModelBundle
** Alternatives
*** Use MLeap
- MLeap is compatible with Tensorflow.
- However, the TF runtime is still needed (see https://mleap-docs.combust.ml/getting-started/)
